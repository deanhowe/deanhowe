# Moof.One/MOOF todo list 2024

- **[Moof Digital](/2024/01/moof-digital)** MOOF:
    - [ ] Get checkboxes working in markdown
    - [ ] Update to latest version of Laravel (v.11)
    - [ ] Add an extension to easily render questions/polls in markdown (is this a thing?)
    - [ ] **[Moof Digital](#moof-digital)**: Promote Moof Digital as __something__.

Users? There is **always** a user, even if it's just me - guest users are also a thing too, and it needs documenting.

SPAM - how to I deal with it? Is it really a problem? Is CloudFlare the only answer? Can I we build trust in users other ways?
