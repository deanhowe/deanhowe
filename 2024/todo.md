 1. * [ ] - Promote Moof Digital as __something__.
 1. * [ ] - figure link vs figure url.
 1. * [ ] Define a config of default OG data
        * should OG desc be the same as the meta description?
 1. * [ ] AI generated images?[^ai-images]
 


```javascript
console.log('Hello World');
```

```php
ray('Hello World')->confetti();
```

Does pineapple belong on pizza?
Should be a "Hello World" in PHP, above?.
